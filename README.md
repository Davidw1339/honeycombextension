# honeycombextension
HoneyComb is a beautiful shopping Chrome extension that allows you to filter with as many tags as you'd like. You can rearrange the filtering tags in order of most important to least important and the extension will order your search results accordingly. We used a combination of JQuery, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
